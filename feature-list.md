# EvergreenHUD Features

### Addons
Other developers can develop their own elements that work seamlessly with the core mod.

### Config Conversion
Users can easily transition to EvergreenHUD from other HUD mods by using the intelligent
configuration conversion. EvergreenHUD detects existing configurations on first launch
and quickly converts it.

### Config Profiles
From one server to the next, a different HUD setup is vital for the greatest efficiency.
You can quickly switch between different profiles quickly and easily.

### Intelligent Element Positioning
No matter the size of your window, elements are positioned proportionately using
advanced position origin and scaling system.

### Duplicate Elements
EvergreenHUD can handle more than one of the same type of element.

### Unique Elements
Unique HUD elements like custom images and frame consistency exist nowhere else.
Also, some basic elements like FPS have the added ability of being updated more
than once per second.

### Fast Startup Times
EvergreenHUD utilises pre-calculated values so that your PC doesn't have to do the
processing. This means it contributes less than half a second of start-up time
(depending on your PC, of course). In fact, EvergreenHUD logs the exact startup
time into your latest.log file!

### Built-in Update Checker
Every time you start the game, EvergreenHUD checks for the latest updates, so you always
keep up to date.

### Ban Preventer
If a vital issue is detected by the developer, EvergreenHUD will prevent you from using
the bad version and prevent any unwanted bans.
