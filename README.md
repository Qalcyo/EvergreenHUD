EvergreenHUD is a forge mod to improve and add upon your heads up display.
I, Xander, have been working on this mod for over 3 months and believe it really
is the best HUD mod out there for 1.8.

#### Announcement
I would love if someone could work on a multi-version system for the mod as I
think it could become very popular for fabric players and maybe even modpacks.
