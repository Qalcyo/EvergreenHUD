# Addons API
EvergreenHUD addons are a unique feature to HUD mods. It allows
users to add extra elements that may not fit in the base mod.

## Addons for Users
You may be wondering how you can use an already-made addon. It is super
easy! Just add the .jar to your usual fabric mods folder
(usually located at `.minecraft/mods`)

On startup, EvergreenHUD will automatically detect and load the addon
and your elements will be available to use.
